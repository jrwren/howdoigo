== What is this?

This is a FAQ which deals specifically with questions of the form "How do I...?".

The inspiration for this documentation is perlfaq. While many sections of perlfaq are answered adequately in other places such as http://golang.org/doc/effective_go.html[Effective Go] and the http://golang.org/doc/faq[Go FAQ], the example code in sections 4, 5 and 6 of perlfaq are not as well represented. This document is an attempt to rectify that underrepresentation.


== Data Manipulation


=== How do I make int() work?

Its not. The numbers may not be what you think.

e.g.
--------------------------------------
fmt.Println(int(1.0-0.9-0.1))
--------------------------------------
.results in a compiler error:

=====================================================================
constant -8.45304e-132 truncated to integer
=====================================================================
This is because of the way computers represent floating-point numbers. See
David Goldberg's
http://web.cse.msu.edu/~cse320/Documents/FloatingPoint.pdf[What Every Computer
Scientist Should Know About Floating-Point Arithmetic]


=== Why isn't my octal data interpreted correctly?

string='0555'
